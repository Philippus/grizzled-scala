* Added `findReadline()` convenience method to `grizzled.readline.Readline`.
  This method attempts to find and load a suitable Readline library.
* Updated to build against Scala 2.8.0.RC2, as well as Scala 2.8.0.RC1.
* Cleaned up `grizzled.file.util.deleteTree` method.
* Added versions of `grizzled.file.util.copyFile`, 
  `grizzled.file.util.copyTree`, and `grizzled.file.util.deleteTree` that
  take `java.io.File` objects.
* Maven artifact now includes Scala version (e.g., `grizzled-scala_2.8.0.RC1`,
  instead of `grizzled-scala`).
