* Added `findReadline()` convenience method to `grizzled.readline.Readline`.
  This method attempts to find and load a suitable Readline library.
* Cleaned up `grizzled.file.util.deleteTree` method.
* Added versions of `grizzled.file.util.copyFile`, 
  `grizzled.file.util.copyTree`, and `grizzled.file.util.deleteTree` that
  take `java.io.File` objects.
* Replaced `grizzled.io.useThenClose` with the more flexible
  `grizzled.io.withCloseable`. (`useThenClose` is still present, but
  it's deprecated.)
* Added `copyTo()` method to `grizzled.file.GrizzledFile`, which can be
  implicitly mixed into `java.io.File`.
* Ensured that various supposedly tail-recursive methods are marked with
  `@tailrec`, to be sure.
* Maven artifact now includes Scala version (e.g., `grizzled-scala_2.8.0.RC2`,
  instead of `grizzled-scala`).
* Updated to build against Scala 2.8.0.RC2, as well as Scala 2.8.0.RC1.
