* Bumped to [SBT][] version 0.7.4.

* Added ability to "parse" (i.e., emit) plain text and HTML/XHTML to the
  `grizzled.parsing.markup` package.
* Updated to [Knockoff][] version 0.7.1-12, which corrects some Markdown
  translation bugs.
* Fixed `grizzled-scala` artifact publishing bug ([issue #1][]).
* Removed support for Scala 2.8.0.RC2.
* Changed SBT publishing to use an SSH key file, to eliminate the Ivy
