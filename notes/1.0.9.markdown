* Fixed `grizzled.readline` so that a newline in the prompt doesn't return
  `None` (for EOF).
* Based on [pull request #3][], by [Dan Sully][], added the following
  features to `grizzled.config`:
  - Section name regular expression can now be specified to `Configuration`
    objects, thus allowing alternate section name forms.
  - Comment regular expression can now be specified to `Configuration`,
    allowing alternate comment syntaxes.
  - `Configuration` now supports at `getAsList()` method, which returns
    a value split into a string list. Delimiters may be specified. The
    value returned is of type `Option[List[String]]`.
