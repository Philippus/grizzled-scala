* Added the `grizzled.math.stats` module, which contains some common
  statistics functions (`geometricMean()`, `harmonicMean()`, `mean()`,
  `median()`, `mode()`, `variance()` and `stddev()`, for instance).
* Scaladoc documentation is now generated with a proper title.
* Fixed problem where `grizzled.cmd` failed to find a Readline library,
  because of an inadvertent change of a constant from a `def` to a `val`.
* Now compiles against [Scala][] 2.8.1 RC2, as well as 2.8.0.
