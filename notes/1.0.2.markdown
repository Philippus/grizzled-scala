* Added the `grizzled.math.stats` module, which contains some common
  statistics functions, including: `geometricMean()`, `harmonicMean()`,
  `mean()`, `median()`, `mode()`, `populationVariance()`
  `populationStandardDeviation()`. Most were adapted from
  Gary Strangman's `stats.py` Python module. (See
  [http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/Neural_Systems_Group/gary/python.html][].)
* Scaladoc documentation is now generated with a proper title.
* Fixed problem where `grizzled.cmd` failed to find a Readline library,
  because of an inadvertent change of a constant from a `def` to a `val`.
* Now compiles against [Scala][] 2.8.1 RC2, as well as 2.8.0.
