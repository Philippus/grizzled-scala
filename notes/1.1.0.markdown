* Built for the Scala 2.10.0 series _only_ (2.10.0-M7, initially). **This
  version, and later versions, are 2.10-only. 2.9.x and earlier will be
  supported via the 1.0.x release branch.** This is due to changes in the
  Scala library between 2.9 and 2.10.
* Converted code to use 2.10 reflection API.
* Added `-feature` to `scalac` options, and removed all feature warnings.
  In many cases, this simply necessitating importing various `scala.language`
  packages, such as `scala.language.reflectiveCalls` and
  `scala.language.implicitConversions`.
* Removed use of `val` in `for` comprehensions, as it's now deprecated.
* Upgraded build to SBT 0.12.
* Moved `GrizzledFile.listRecursively()` functionality from `GrizzledFile`
  (which is intended to enhance `java.io.File` implicitly) to
  `grizzled.file.util` package, where it is more easily invoked directly.
  Replaced `GrizzledFile.listRecursively()` with a simple wrapper that
  invokes `grizzled.file.util.listRecursively()`.
* Converted use of `scala.collection.JavaConversions.IterableWrapper` (which
  is deprecated in 2.10) to `scala.collection.convert.JIterableWrapper`.
