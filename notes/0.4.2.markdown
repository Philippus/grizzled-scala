* Updated to the released version of [SBT][] 0.7.2.
* Added `withDownloadedFile()` to `grizzled.net.url`, to execute a block on
  a downloaded URL.
* The `grizzled.io.implicits` module has been replaced by individual 
  modules, for more granular scope control (e.g.,
  `grizzled.io.RichInputStream`, `grizzled.io.RichReader`)
* The `grizzled.io` package has been split into individual source files.
* Added new `grizzled.io.SourceReader` class that wraps a `scala.io.Source`
  inside a `java.io.Reader`.
