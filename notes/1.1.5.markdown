* Added `grizzled.either`, which contains enrichments for the `Either`
  class, including `map()` and `flatMap()` methods that map when the
  value is `Right` (and permits easier use of `Either` objects in
  `for` comprehensions).
* Increased file copying speed in `grizzled.io.RichInputStream` by
  adding buffering. (Fix supplied by [Jim Fulton](https://github.com/jimfulton)
* `grizzled.math.stats.range()` of a single value now returns 0, as it should.
  Addresses [Issue #4](https://github.com/bmc/grizzled-scala/issues/4)
* Upgraded to latest version of ScalaTest.
