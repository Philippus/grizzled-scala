* Added `BlockCommandHandler` to `grizzled`.cmd, to handle commands consisting
  of blocks of lines between a start and end line.
* Added `HiddenCommandHandler` to `grizzled.cmd`, allowing special commands 
  that are not displayed in the help.
* Changed EOF handling in `grizzled.cmd` slightly.
* Fixed problem with prefix handling in `grizzled.string.WordWrapper`.
