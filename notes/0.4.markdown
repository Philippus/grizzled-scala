* Added `grizzled.collection.GrizzledLinearSeq` and related implicits, as a
  place to put additional methods for sequences.
* Added `grizzled.collection.GrizzledLinearSeq.columnarize()`, which takes a
  sequence (e.g., a list), converts its contents to strings, and returns a
  single string with the sequence's contents arranged in columns.
* Rearranged the locations of various implicit functions, so callers can
  have finer-grained control over which ones are in scope.
* `grizzled.editline.EditLine` now shows its completions in columnar format.
* Added `BlockCommandHandler` to `grizzled`.cmd, to handle commands consisting
  of blocks of lines between a start and end line.
* Added `HiddenCommandHandler` to `grizzled.cmd`, allowing special commands 
  that are not displayed in the help.
* Changed EOF handling in `grizzled.cmd` slightly.
* Added `createTemporaryDirectory()` and `withTemporaryDirectory()` to
  `grizzled.file.util` module.
* Added `isEmpty` to `grizzled.file.GrizzledFile` (which can be implicitly
  converted to and from `java.io.File`).
* Fixed problem with prefix handling in `grizzled.string.WordWrapper`.
* Now uses [SBT][sbt] 0.7.2 to build from source.
