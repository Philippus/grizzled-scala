* Added `BlockCommandHandler` to `grizzled`.cmd, to handle commands consisting
  of blocks of lines between a start and end line.
* Added `HiddenCommandHandler` to `grizzled.cmd`, allowing special commands 
  that are not displayed in the help.
* Changed EOF handling in `grizzled.cmd` slightly.
* Added `createTemporaryDirectory()` and `withTemporaryDirectory()` to
  `grizzled.file.util` module.
- Added `isEmpty` to `grizzled.file.GrizzledFile` (which can be implicitly
  converted to and from `java.io.File`).
* Fixed problem with prefix handling in `grizzled.string.WordWrapper`.
* Now uses [SBT][sbt] 0.7.2
