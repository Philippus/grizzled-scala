* Updated to Scala 2.8.0.RC1.
* Replaced uses of now-deprecated `Math` functions with corresponding functions
  from `scala.math`.
* Enhanced `grizzled.config.Configuration`:
  - It now has a forMatchingSections() method that allows simple looping over
    sections that match a regular expression.
  - It now supports an alternative to the option() methods: a get() method
    that returns `Option[String]` and does not throw exceptions.
  - It supports a `setOption()` method that overwrites an option value, if it
    exists already, instead of throwing a `DuplicateOptionException`, as 
    `addOption()` does.
  - `ConfigurationReader` is deprecated, and the logic to read a configuration
    file has been moved into the `Configuration` class, to permit easier
    subclassing.
  - Now supports a "safe load" mode, where exceptions aren't thrown.
  - Added unit tests for the `Configuration` class.
  - Added ability to retrieve converted integer and boolean option values.
