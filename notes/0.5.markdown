* Enhanced `grizzled.config.Configuration` with a `forMatchingSections()`
  method that allows simple looping over sections that match a regular

* `grizzled.config.Configuration` now supports an alternative to the `option()`
  methods: a `get()` method that returns `Option[String]` and does not throw
  exceptions.
