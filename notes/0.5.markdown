* Updated to Scala 2.8.0.RC1.
* Replaced uses of now-deprecated `Math` functions with corresponding functions
  from `scala.math`.
* Enhanced `grizzled.config.Configuration`:
  - A `forMatchingSections()` method allows simple looping over sections that
    match a regular expression.
  - A `matchingSections()` methods returns a sequence of sections that match
    a regular expression.
  - The `options()` method now returns an empty map if the section doesn't
    exist, instead of throwing an exception.
  - A new `setOption()` method overwrites an option value, if it exists already,
    instead of throwing a `DuplicateOptionException`, as `addOption()` does.
  - `ConfigurationReader` is deprecated, and the logic to read a configuration
    file has been moved into the `Configuration` class, to permit easier
    subclassing.
  - Now supports a "safe load" mode, where exceptions aren't thrown.
  - Added unit tests for the `Configuration` class.
  - Added ability to retrieve converted integer and boolean option values.
  - The `option()` methods are now deprecated, in favor of new `get()` and
    `getOrElse()` methods that are modeled after their `Map` counterparts.
