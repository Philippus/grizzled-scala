`grizzled.cmd` changes:

* "history" command now uses the syntax `history [-n] [regex]`
   where *n* is the maximum number of entries to show, and *regex* is a
   regular expression to filter history entries.

* Some commands starting with "." were being incorrectly limited to a
  single character (e.g., ".r", but not ".read").

* General clean-up and bug fixing in the "redo command" handler.

* `CommandHandler` classes can now exempt themselves from the history.

* The `RedoCommandHandler` (which handles the "r" and "!" commands) now
  exempts itself from the history.
