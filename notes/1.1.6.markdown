* Removed the `grizzled.generator` package, as it relies on the unsupported
  and unmaintained Scala continuations plugin.
* Changed `grizzled.file.util.listRecursively()` to use Scala `Stream` objects,
  which permit lazy evaluation. It's a better, and simpler, solution than
  continuation passing.
* Now cross-compiled for Scala 2.11.
* Published to Bintray.
* Updated to SBT 0.13.2
