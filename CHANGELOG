Version 0.5 (...)

- Updated to Scala 2.8.0.RC1.
- Replaced uses of now-deprecated Math functions with corresponding functions
  from scala.math.
- Enhanced grizzled.config.Configuration:
  * It now has a forMatchingSections() method that allows simple looping over
    sections that match a regular expression.
  * It now supports an alternative to the option() methods: a get() method
    that returns Option[String] and does not throw exceptions.
  * It supports a setOption() method that overwrites an option value, if it
    exists already, instead of throwing a DuplicateOptionException, as 
    addOption() does.
  * ConfigurationReader is deprecated, and the logic to read a configuration
    file has been moved into the Configuration class, to permit easier
    subclassing.
  * Now supports a "safe load" mode, where exceptions aren't thrown.
  * Added unit tests for the Configuration class.

Version 0.4.2 (7 April, 2010)

- Updated to SBT version 0.7.3.
- Added withDownloadedFile() to grizzled.net.url, to execute a block on
  a downloaded URL.
- The grizzled.io.implicits module has been replaced by individual 
  modules, for more granular scope control (e.g.,
  grizzled.io.RichInputStream, grizzled.io.RichReader)
- The grizzled.io package has been split into individual source files.
- Added new grizzled.io.SourceReader class that wraps a scala.io.Source inside
  a java.io.Reader.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.1 (11 March, 2010)

- Fixed inadvertent bug in grizzled.cmd command handling, when commands
  span multiple lines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4 (11 March, 2010)

- Added grizzled.collection.GrizzledLinearSeq and related implicits, as a place
  to put additional methods for sequences.
- Added grizzled.collection.GrizzledLinearSeq.columnarize(), which takes a
  sequence (e.g., a list), converts its contents to strings, and returns a
  single string with the sequence's contents arranged in columns.
- Rearranged the locations of various implicit functions, so callers can
  have finer-grained control over which ones are in scope.
- grizzled.editline.EditLine now shows its completions in columnar format.
- Added BlockCommandHandler to grizzled.cmd, to handle commands consisting
  of blocks of lines between a start and end line.
- Added HiddenCommandHandler to grizzled.cmd, allowing special commands that
  are not displayed in the help.
- Changed EOF handling in grizzled.cmd slightly.
- Added createTemporaryDirectory() and withTemporaryDirectory() to
  grizzled.file.util module.
- Added isEmpty() to grizzled.file.GrizzledFile (which can be implicitly
  converted to and from java.io.File).
- Fixed problem with prefix handling in grizzled.string.WordWrapper.
- Now requires sbt 0.7.2 to build from source.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.1 (2 March, 2010)

- grizzled.cmd changes:

  * "history" command now uses this syntax:
        history [-n] [regex]
     where "n" is the maximum number of entries to show, and "regex" is a
     regular expression to filter history entries.
  * Some commands starting with "." were being incorrectly limited to a
    single character (e.g., ".r", but not ".read").
  * General clean-up and bug fixing in the "redo command" handler.
  * CommandHandler classes can now exempt themselves from the history.
  * The RedoCommandHandler (which handles the "r" and "!" commands) now
    exempts itself from the history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 (20 February, 2010)

- Converted to Scala 2.8.0
- Now must be compiled with sbt version 0.7.0 or better.
- Fixed tail call optimization problem in grizzled.io.RichInputStream.
  Thanks to Claudio Bley (cbley /at/ av-test.de)
- Added grizzled.parsing.MarkdownParser, for parsing Markdown documents.
  (Uses the Showdown Javascript library, via Mozilla Rhino.)
- grizzled.cmd.HelpHandler now supports a ".help" alias.
- Added grizzled.util.withCloseable control structure.
- The grizzled.readline API now uses org.clapper.editline EditLine
  implementation, instead of the one in Java-Readline. Completion handling
  is more reliable with the Java Editline implementation.
- grizzled.cmd now tries to load EditLine first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2 (31 August, 2009)

- In grizzled.cmd, the default handler for the "help" command now does
  tab completion on the existing commands.
- Changed the way grizzled.readline exposes completion context. Instead of
  exposing a cursor, it exposes a tokenized list, with a special Cursor token.
  This approach fits better with Scala's pattern matching.
- grizzled.collection.MultiIterator is now covariant, not invariant.
- Miscellaneous internal changes where "yield" is used.
- Changed license to New BSD License.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1 (1 August, 2009)

- First release.
