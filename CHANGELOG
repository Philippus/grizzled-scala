Version 0.3 (...)

- Converted to Scala 2.8.0
- Now must be compiled with sbt version 0.7.0 or better.
- Fixed tail call optimization problem in grizzled.io.RichInputStream.
  Thanks to Claudio Bley (cbley /at/ av-test.de)
- Added grizzled.parsing.MarkdownParser, for parsing Markdown documents.
  (Uses the Showdown Javascript library, via Mozilla Rhino.)
- grizzled.cmd.HelpHandler now supports a ".help" alias.
- Added grizzled.util.withCloseable control structure.
- The grizzled.readline API now uses org.clapper.editline EditLine
  implementation, instead of the one in Java-Readline. Completion handling
  is more reliable with the Java Editline implementation.
- grizzled.cmd now tries to load EditLine first.

Version 0.2 (31 August, 2009)

- In grizzled.cmd, the default handler for the "help" command now does
  tab completion on the existing commands.
- Changed the way grizzled.readline exposes completion context. Instead of
  exposing a cursor, it exposes a tokenized list, with a special Cursor token.
  This approach fits better with Scala's pattern matching.
- grizzled.collection.MultiIterator is now covariant, not invariant.
- Miscellaneous internal changes where "yield" is used.
- Changed license to New BSD License.
