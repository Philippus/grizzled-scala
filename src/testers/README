This directory contains miscellaneous, non-automated testers. Generally,
the files in here are intended to be run manually at the command line,
often as Scala scripts. I use them to test various assumptions while I'm
developing or modifying the code.

These scripts are NOT for use with ScalaCheck or ScalaTest, and they are
deliberately excluded from ScalaTest runs.
