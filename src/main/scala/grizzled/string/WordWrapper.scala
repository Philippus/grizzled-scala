package grizzled.string

import scala.annotation.tailrec

/** Wraps strings on word boundaries to fit within a proscribed output
  * width. The wrapped string may have a prefix or not; prefixes are useful
  * for error messages, for instance. You tell a `WordWrapper` about
  * a prefix by passing a non-empty prefix to the constructor.
  *
  * <h2>Examples:</h2>
  *
  * {{{Unable to open file /usr/local/etc/wombat: No such file or directory}}}
  *
  * might appear like this without a prefix:
  *
  * {{{
  * Unable to open file /usr/local/etc/wombat: No such file or
  * directory
  * }}}
  *
  * and like this if the prefix is "myprog:"
  *
  * {{{
  * myprog: Unable to open file /usr/local/etc/wombat: No such
  *         file or directory
  * }}}
  *
  * Alternatively, if the output width is shortened, the same message
  * can be made to wrap something like this:
  *
  * {{{
  * myprog: Unable to open file
  *         /usr/local/etc/wombat:
  *         No such file or
  *         directory
  * }}}
  *
  * Note how the wrapping logic will "tab" past the prefix on wrapped
  * lines.
  *
  * This method also supports the notion of an indentation level, which is
  * independent of the prefix. A non-zero indentation level causes each line,
  * including the first line, to be indented that many characters. Thus,
  * initializing a `WordWrapper` object with an indentation value of 4
  * will cause each output line to be preceded by 4 blanks. (It's also
  * possible to change the indentation character from a blank to any other
  * character.
  *
  * <h2>Notes</h2>
  *
  * - The class does not do any special processing of tab characters.
  *   Embedded tab characters can have surprising (and unwanted) effects
  *   on the rendered output.
  * - Wrapping an already wrapped string is an invitation to trouble.
  *
  * @param wrapWidth   the number of characters after which to wrap each line
  * @param indentation how many characters to indent
  * @param prefix      the prefix to use, or "" for none. Cannot be null.
  * @param ignore      set of characters to ignore when calculating wrapping.
  *                    This feature can be useful when certain characters
  *                    represent escape characters, and you intend to
  *                    post-process the wrapped string.
  * @param indentChar  the indentation character to use.
