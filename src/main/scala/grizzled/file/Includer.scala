/** Process "include" directives in files, returning an iterator over
  * lines from the flattened files.
  *
  * The `grizzled.file.Includer` class can be used to process "include"
  * directives within a text file, returning a file-like object. It also
  * contains some utility functions that permit using include-enabled files
  * in other contexts.
  *
  * <h3>Syntax</h3>
  *
  * The <i>include</i> syntax is defined by a regular expression; any
  * line that matches the regular expression is treated as an <i>include</i>
  * directive. The default regular expression, `^%include\s"([^"]+)"$`
  * matches include directives like this:
  *
  * {{{
  * %include "/absolute/path/to/file"
  * %include "../relative/path/to/file"
  * %include "local_reference"
  * %include "http://localhost/path/to/my.config"
  * }}}
  *
  * Relative and local file references are relative to the including file
  * or URL. That is, if an `Includer` is processing file
  * "/home/bmc/foo.txt" and encounters an attempt to include file "bar.txt",
  * it will assume "bar.txt" is to be found in "/home/bmc".
  *
  * Similarly, if an `Includer` is processing URL
  * "http://localhost/bmc/foo.txt" and encounters an attempt to include file
  * "bar.txt", it will assume "bar.txt" is to be found at
  * "http://localhost/bmc/bar.txt".
  *
  * Nested includes are permitted; that is, an included file may, itself,
  * include other files. The maximum recursion level is configurable and
  * defaults to 100.
  *
  * The include syntax can be changed by passing a different regular
  * expression to the `Includer` constructor.
  *
  * <h3>Usage</h3>
  *
  * This package provides an `Includer` class, which processes include
  * directives in a file and behaves somewhat like a Scala `Source`. See the
  * class documentation for more details.
  *
  * The package also provides a `preprocess()` convenience function, via a
  * companion object, that can be used to preprocess a file; it returns the
  * path to the resulting preprocessed file.
  *
  * <h3>Examples</h3>
  *
  * Preprocess a file containing include directives, then read the result:
  *
  * {{{
  * import grizzled.file.Includer
  *
  * Includer(path).foreach(println(_))
  * }}}
  *
  * Use an include-enabled file with a Scala `scala.io.Source`
  * object:
  *
  * {{{
  * import grizzled.file.includer.Includer
  * import scala.io.Source
  *
  * val source = Source.fromFile(Includer.preprocess("/path/to/file"))
  * }}}
  *
  * @param source       the source to read
  * @param includeRegex the regular expression that defines an include directive.
  *                     Must contain a group that surrounds the file or URL part.
  * @param maxNesting   the maximum nesting level
