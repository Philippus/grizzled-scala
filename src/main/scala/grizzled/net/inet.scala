/** Represents an IP address. This class is similar to `java.net.InetAddress`,
  * but it's designed to be more intuitive and easier to use from Scala.
  * This package provides implicit converters to make this class compatible
  * with `java.net.InetAddress`. The converters ensure that all the
  * (non-static) methods defined in the `java.net.InetAddress` class are
  * directly callable from an instance of the Scala `IPAddress` class. For
  * instance, the following code is perfectly legal:
  *
  * {{{
  * val ip = IPAddress(192, 168, 2, 5)
  *
  * // Test if the address is reachable within 1 second.
  * println(ip + " is reachable? " + ip.isReachable(1000))
  *
  * // Get the canonical host name for (i.e., do a reverse lookup on) the
  * // address.
  * println(ip + " -> " + ip.getCanonicalHostName)
  *
  * // Determine whether it's the loopback address.
  * println(ip + " == loopback? " + ip.isLoopbackAddress)
  * }}}
  *
  * Here's an IPv6 example:
  *
  * {{{
  * val ip = IPAddress("fe80::21d:9ff:fea7:53e3")
  *
  * // Test if the address is reachable within 1 second.
  * println(ip + " is reachable? " + ip.isReachable(1000))
  *
  * // Get the canonical host name for (i.e., do a reverse lookup on) the
  * // address.
  * println(ip + " -> " + ip.getCanonicalHostName)
  *
  * // Determine whether it's the loopback address.
  * println(ip + " == loopback? " + ip.isLoopbackAddress)
