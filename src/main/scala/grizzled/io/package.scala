    * `java.io.Closeable`.

    *     in => ...

    * The closeable object is not passed into the block, because its type
    * is useless to the block.

    * @param closeable  the object that implements `Closeable`
    * @param code       the code block to execute with the `Closeable`
    *
    * @return whatever the block returns
