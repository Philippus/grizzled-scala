/** `SafeIterator` places a simple stream on top of an iterator,
  * returning `Option`-wrapped instances from the underlying iterator.

  * `None`. Differences from a plain `Iterator` include:
  *
  * - An `SafeIterator` will not throw an exception if you try to read
  *   past the end of it. Instead, it will just keep returning `None`.
  *
  * Example of use with a string:
  *
  * {{{
  * import grizzled.parsing.SafeIterator
  *
  * val s = ...
  * val istream = new SafeIterator[Char](s.elements)
  * }}}
