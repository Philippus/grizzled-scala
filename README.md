Grizzled Scala: A general-purpose library of Scala classes and objects
======================================================================

## Introduction

This is the Grizzled Scala Library, which is similar to the clapper.org
[Grizzled Python][] Library, only for Scala. (Duh.) It contains a variety
of miscellaneous utility classes and objects. Basically, whenever I find
myself writing something that's general-purpose, I put it in here, so I can
easily use it in multiple projects.

The home page for the Grizzled Scala Library is
<http://bmc.github.com/grizzled-scala/>. Please see that page for
complete details, including installation instructions.
